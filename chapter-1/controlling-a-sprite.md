# Controlling a Sprite

## Input, Sprite, Texture and View

The goal of this chapter is to establish a controllable player object, visually represented by a sprite. This requires the implementation of user input handling, the instantiation of a sprite object, and the loading of a texture for rendering the sprite.&#x20;

Finally, we'll manage the view of the game so that it remains centered on the player's position as it navigates the game world.
