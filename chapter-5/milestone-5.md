# Milestone 5

## Improved Map, Cameras, and User Interface

A new, more complete, and fun map is playable. Orange blocks are breakable by the player by hitting them from the bottom.

The camera follows the player. The view clamps itself to always stay within the bounds of the map, to avoid showing the blank background. Even when the window is resized, the camera ensures that the condition still holds.

If the player falls from the map or it gets hit by the mushroom, it disappears, a lose canvas is shown, and pressing the Enter key reloads the scene.

There is no win condition yet.
