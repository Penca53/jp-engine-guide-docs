# Milestone 6

## Animations, Plants, and End Cup&#x20;

The player plays different animations depending on its state. "Idle" when not moving, "running" when moving, "jump" and then "fall" while jumping. If the player gets hit by a mushroom, a plant, or a plant bullet, it plays a hit animation and disappears.

The banana plays an animation until it's collected.

The mushroom plays a walking animation, and when hit, it plays a hit animation and disappears.

The plant plays an idle animation, and every once in a while, it shoots a bullet while playing a shooting animation. When hit by the player, it plays a hit animation and disappears.

The plant bullet travels at constant speed horizontally in the same direction as the plant that shot it. If it hits the map, it gets destroyed.

When the player jumps on top of the cup, the cup plays an animation, and the game is won. By pressing the Enter key, the scene gets reloaded.
