# Milestone 1

## Controllable Player

A player controllable with the WASD keyboard keys. Notice how the sprite is mirrored when the movement direction changes (left and right).

The window's view is locked onto the player, "following" it. Later on in the guide, we'll add a new mechanism to replace this temporary "follow" method, Cameras!
