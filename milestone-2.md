# Milestone 2

## World, Background, and Mushroom

&#x20;A player controllable with the AD keys (left, right) to move horizontally and Spacebar key to jump. The player and mushroom are affected by gravity and collide with the world map, making it impossible to escape the level.

Notice how the mushroom flips direction (and consequently the sprite is mirrored) when it touches a wall.
